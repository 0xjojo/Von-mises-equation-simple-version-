Will it yield ????
It takes a lot of time of mechanical engineers to make a design of mechanical component and then thay make a lot of calculations if their selection of the material is correct or not 
Will the geometry of the component will hold out the forces and stresses applied on it or not
This program is just beginning about is this component logical or not 
The program may suggest what to do to solve the problem if the component will yield under these stresses 
Our calculations will depend on von mises theory
